# Canvas Peer Grade Calculator

The Peer Review Tool makes grading a peer review assignment much easier. 
After your students have reviewed and graded their peers, you can use this tool to easily view individual grades and comments, calculate average scores, identify outliers, export grades to Excel and import average scores to the Canvas grade book.
This does not replace the Canvas peer review tool, it only enhances the grading portion.
